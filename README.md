# Howdy, partner!

It's me, **Vykula**, and I'm a beginner developer.

I'm currently (and protractedly) interested in **Web applications**, **Game development** and **3D modeling**.   
Recently started working on procedural generation and non-euclidean spaces.

Looking for help with inspiration, ready to join some cool and intriguing projects.
