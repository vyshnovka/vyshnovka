# Howdy, partner!

It's me, **Victoria**, and I'm a highly-motivated and enthusiastic game developer.

Since the beginning of my journey I've been working on **indie games** to amuse my friends and please my soul and step by step going along the path of creating smth worthwhile.    
Mostly a programmer, but also a self-taught designer and occasional 3D artist. Good at algorithms and implementing ideas into functional code.    
Recently I started studying procedural generation, non-euclidean spaces and a tiny bit of graphics.

Looking for help with inspiration, ready to join some cool and intriguing projects.
